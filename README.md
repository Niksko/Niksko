## What I'm working on

I'm currently serving as a Principal Developer Advocate in the Developer Productivity team at SEEK.
We're working to make developers at SEEK more productive, which means we care about products like:

- CI/CD pipelines
- how we deploy containers
- how developers interact with source code
- how developers interact with our technology platform day-to-day

Right now I'm spending a lot of time laying the foundations for a product-based approach to how we work.
I'm also interested in how we make sure that our (internal) customers are at the centre of the work we do.
I'm getting more and more interested in remote work practices, which prompted the creation of this page!

## How I like to work

More and more I'm trying to embrace fully remote, asynchronous ways of working.
I like writing things down beacause it allows me to communicate clearly and thoughtfully.
I find it easier to express myself concisely and clearly in writing, but I also feel that writing is more durable
and easier to iterate on than verbal communication.

You're far more likely to find me working later in the afternoon than in the early morning.
It's rare that I'm around before 9am Australian time, and don't be surprised if you see a pull request as late as
6 or 7pm Australian time depending on what's going on at home.
But as I said above, I'm trying to work more asynchronously, so this info about my hours should matter less and less
over time.

Earlier in my career I hated any form of planning.
I'm slowly coming around.
But I still often default to 'lets just build something barebones and iterate on it' over 'lets have lots of meetings
and figure this out perfectly before we do anything'.

I often have strong opinions, but they're loosley held.
I believe that being able to quickly change your mind in the face of new information is a virtue, and I tend to change
direction very quickly when this happens.

### Types of documents I tend to write

I write a lot at work.
Here's a brief guide to some of the things I've been writing a lot of lately.

You'll see me writing 'proposals' or 'strategies' when I have ideas about changes or improvements I'd like to make to
systems and processes.
The more controversial or wide-ranging the changes, the more I feel the need to write a 'strategy' that articulates
the multitude of problems and the common 'policies' that we can apply to end up with a set of actions.

You'll see me writing 'logs' of things (not generally what I end up calling them, but that's kind of what they are)
when I do something that I feel is noteworthy or otherwise might be worth documenting for the future.

I also tend to write down my ideas for how to run meetings or rituals before I've actually run them.
This helps me get all of my ideas down somewhere so that I don't forget them, and so that I can make sure that they're
clearly articulated ahead of time.
I'll then often iterate on these by having a 'notes' section at the bottom of the page with notes from how this meeting or
ritual went, with suggestions for how to improve the next time around.

## What I've worked on in the past

In the past I've done a lot of Kubernetes wrangling, and I still try to keep up to date with the latest and greatest.
I've done a bunch of teaching and mentoring of junior developers, and try to get involved with programs that let me
share knowledge and help people understand new concepts wherever I can.
I also studied mathematics in university, specializing in numerical methods for differential equations.
I'm pretty rusty, but I do enjoy a math or logic problem.

## Hobbies

An ever growing list...

Food and drink is a big hobby, both eating and cooking.
Some of my adventures are on my blog, but there's a lot more to be discussed.
A short list of stuff I've done deep dives into:

- Miso and shoyu (soy sauce) making
- Cocktails
- Carbonation
- Coffee
- Bread and milling your own flour
- Lacto fermentation
- Cured fish products (tuna bacon)

I never really was a sports guy, but now I try and watch Vancouver Canucks games.
Maybe it just took a sport completely divorced from my home country and culture to get me interested?

My 3D printing is pretty rusty, but it's something I've tinkered with in the past and hope to again.

I like taking photos, though I'm not particularly good at it, and can never seem to get around to editing them.

I have a cute black and white tuxedo cat name Sofia who I love very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
